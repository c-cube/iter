(** {1 Simple and Efficient Iterators} *)

(** The iterators are designed to allow easy transfer (mappings) between data
    structures, without defining [n^2] conversions between the [n] types. The
    implementation relies on the assumption that a sequence can be iterated
    on as many times as needed; this choice allows for high performance
    of many combinators. However, for transient iterators, the {!persistent}
    function is provided, storing elements of a transient iterator
    in memory; the iterator can then be used several times (See further).

    Note that some combinators also return sequences (e.g. {!group}). The
    transformation is computed on the fly every time one iterates over
    the resulting sequence. If a transformation performs heavy computation,
    {!persistent} can also be used as intermediate storage.

    Most functions are {b lazy}, i.e. they do not actually use their arguments
    until their result is iterated on. For instance, if one calls {!map}
    on a sequence, one gets a new sequence, but nothing else happens until
    this new sequence is used (by folding or iterating on it).

    If a sequence is built from an iteration function that is {b repeatable}
    (i.e. calling it several times always iterates on the same set of
    elements, for instance List.iter or Map.iter), then
    the resulting {!t} object is also repeatable. For {b one-time iter functions}
    such as iteration on a file descriptor or a {!Stream},
    the {!persistent} function can be used to iterate and store elements in
    a memory structure; the result is a sequence that iterates on the elements
    of this memory structure, cheaply and repeatably. *)

(** A sequence of values of type ['a]. If you give it a function ['a -> unit]

(** {2 Basic IO}

    Very basic interface to manipulate files as sequence of chunks/lines. The
    sequences take care of opening and closing files properly; every time
    one iterates over a sequence, the file is opened/closed again.

    Example: copy a file ["a"] into file ["b"], removing blank lines:

    {[
      Sequence.(IO.lines_of "a" |> filter (fun l-> l<> "") |> IO.write_lines "b");;
    ]}

    By chunks of [4096] bytes:

    {[
      Sequence.IO.(chunks_of ~size:4096 "a" |> write_to "b");;
    ]}

    Read the lines of a file into a list:

    {[
      Sequence.IO.lines "a" |> Sequence.to_list
    ]}
